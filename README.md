# Tokamak Plasma Visualizing Tool Kit

A comprehensive tokamak plasma simulation toolkit built on TokaMaker from the OpenFUSIONToolkit, designed for visualizing of vertical displacement events. 

## Overview

This project provides a complete framework for tokamak plasma simulation, including:
- Interactive web-based vacuum vessel design and visualization
- Plasma equilibrium calculations using the Grad-Shafranov equation
- Real-time plasma parameter configuration and validation
- Poloidal field coil placement with geometric constraint checking
- Computational mesh generation with configurable resolution
- Automated simulation execution and results visualization
- Timestamped simulation output management

## Interactive Visualizer

The Streamlit-based interactive visualizer (`streamlit_app.py`) provides a comprehensive web interface for tokamak design and analysis:

### Key Features
- **Real-time Plasma Configuration**: Interactive sliders for major radius, minor radius, elongation, and triangularity
- **Advanced Parameter Control**: Configurable magnetic field parameters (B0, Ip_target, ffp_alpha, etc.)
- **Interactive Vacuum Vessel Design**: Click-and-drag interface for vacuum vessel boundary modification
- **Intelligent Coil Placement**: Drag-and-drop coil positioning with automatic validation
- **Live Visualization**: Real-time Plotly-based cross-sectional views with plasma, vacuum vessel, and coil rendering
- **Design Validation**: Automatic checking of geometric constraints (coils outside vessel, plasma containment)
- **One-Click Analysis**: Direct integration with AOE_tokamaker notebook execution
- **Results Dashboard**: Automatic loading and display of simulation outputs (images, GIFs, data)

### Visualizer Workflow
1. **Design Phase**: Configure plasma parameters and modify vacuum vessel geometry
2. **Coil Placement**: Position poloidal field coils with real-time validation feedback
3. **Lock Design**: Save current configuration to JSON for reproducibility
4. **Run Analysis**: Execute AOE_tokamaker simulation with one click
5. **View Results**: Automatic display of generated plots and animations
